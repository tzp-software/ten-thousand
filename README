ten thousand (a dice game)

roll 6 dice 
pick up to score 
if you can you lose your turn

stop to keep your score but only if you didnt pick up all
the dice rolled last

also you cant stop till you reach 1000 points


once a player reaches 10000 other players have a chance to 
come back with one final roll

# ps. Its still not working, trust me, youll be the first 
      to know when it is.
